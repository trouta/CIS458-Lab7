This bash script was created for GVSU's CIS458 class (System Security). The task was to write a piece of malware.

Our malware, once installed on the machine, creates an alias to overwrite all files in the directory that the command 'ls' is run in.

Note: because this was just for a one-week lab and isn't all extensive, you must run the command 'source ~/.bashrc' after running the script for the first time to sync the alias with the shell.
